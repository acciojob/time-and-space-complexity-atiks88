	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of how the runtime of an algorithm or a program grows as the size of the input increases. It provides insights into the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its execution time. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm or a program requires to complete its execution. The space complexity of an algorithm can be measured in terms of the memory it uses to store variables, data structures, and other temporary data during its execution. For instance, when analyzing the space complexity of an algorithm, we might express it as <b>O(n)</b>, indicating that the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
